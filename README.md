# Jgouken
I'm a `Software Programmer`, celebrating **5 years** of Software Programming 🎉5️⃣🎉!
First things first, I'm fueling off of dedication and creativity and slowly growing my reputation as a Software Programmer. I started working with Discord Bots, wanting to learn website and game development for the betterment and interconnection of interests. I have a lot on my plate, but I learn quickly and effectively to ensure I produce the best material I can with the least amount of second-guessing. One day this name may land in the papers! 📰

- Applying to California Institute of Technology.
- Learned **JavaScript**, **Swift**, **Java,** and **C-langs**.[^3]
- Learning **HMTL**, **CSS**, and **Python**.
- **Visual Studio Code** is my editor of choice.
- **Orange** is my color of choice.
