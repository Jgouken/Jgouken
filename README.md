# Works/Volunteers
All of the following are works of Discord.js bots going back to May 17th, 2020 with 27,000+ [^1] lines of code in counting.
Work  | Position | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[The Introvert Advantage](https://github.com/jgouken/the-introvert-advantage) | School Project & Solo | This was done as an assignment. This is a [text-based game](https://the-introvert-advantage.jgouken.repl.co/) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will be expanded significantly in the future.
[Bot-ez-a](https://github.com/Jgouken/BOT-ez-a) | Volunteer Developer (scrapped) | Previously assisted aspiring developers create commands their privated server's needs.
[Make-A-Mand](https://github.com/Jgouken/MakeAMand) | Solo | Self-lead project to create helpful commands not seen in many other bots. Lead to nowhere.
[Discord.js Bot Handler](https://github.com/Jgouken/Discord.js-Basic-Bot-Handler) | Solo | For me and the public to use my code not often seen by others for many functionalities.
[TC-Phone](https://github.com/Jgouken/TC-Phone) | Solo (scrapped) | This was my add-on to Train Central; a "phone" for Discord users to use as their interface to this RPG world (such as an economy system).
[Train Central](https://github.com/Jgouken/Train-Central) | Solo (scrapped) | This was an RPG-like idea using Discord; a train would go around different "regions" and users would have to catch the train to view and go to these regions.
[Junk](https://github.com/Jgouken/Junk) | - | A dump of discarded files of mine lounging on my computer.
[Snake](https://github.com/Jgouken/snake) | Solo | My first HTML video game to show myself the ropes.
[Calculator](https://github.com/Jgouken/calculator) | Solo | My first very simple HTML/CSS program.
[Matrix Development](https://github.com/MatrixDevelopment-GH) | Volunteer Developer (Retired) | Designed new processes and abilities that boosted the bot architecually.
[Wyvern](https://wyvern.host/) ([Discord Bot](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/wyvern)) | Lead Volunteer Developer (Retired) | Previously lead new designs, creations, and commands that suited the bots' needs along with user-friendly capabilities.
[JgoChat](https://github.com/Jgouken/JgoChat) | Solo (scrapped) | A very old project to essentially create ChatGPT (before it was even created) didn't lead to anywhere.

Not mentioned: Private or Discarded repositories. [^2]
#### My Main discord.js index.js File

```javascript
const { Collection, Routes } = require('discord.js');
const config = require('./config/config.js')
const listeners = require('./config/listeners.js');
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const rest = new REST({ version: '10' }).setToken(config.TOKEN);

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const sCommandsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'slash_commands');
const sCommandFiles = fs.readdirSync(sCommandsPath).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));

config.bot.sCommands = new Collection();
let scmds = []

for (const file of sCommandFiles) {
	const command = require(`./slash_commands/${file}`);
	config.bot.sCommands.set(command.data.name, command);
	scmds.push(command.data)
}

rest.put(Routes.applicationGuildCommands(config.clientId, '929575731497951312'), { body: scmds.map(command => command.toJSON()) }).then(() => {
	console.log(`Slash Commands Updated`)
}).catch(console.error);
listeners.execute(config.bot, config.db)

config.bot.login(config.TOKEN)
// Code put together within a private repository.
// Not much code, right? I've allocated more of my time to reorganization, just so that I know exactly where what happens.
```
