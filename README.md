# Jgouken
I'm a `Software Programmer`, celebrating over **6 years** of Software Programming üéâ6Ô∏è‚É£üéâ!
First things first, I'm fueling off of dedication and creativity and slowly growing my reputation as a Software Programmer. I started this journey making bots on Discord, wanting to learn website and game development for the betterment and interconnection of my interests. I have a lot on my plate, but I learn quickly and effectively to ensure I produce the best material I can with the least amount of second-guessing. One day this name may land in the papers! üì∞

Some small plot points about me:
- Attending the Rochester Institute of Technology for Software Engineering.
- I program in **JavaScript** *(node.js, html5)*, **Swift**, **C-Langs**, **Java**, and **HTML5/CSS** with the primary focus towards back-end development. [^3]
- I have basic knowledge of **Unity** and **Unreal** gaming engines.
- **Visual Studio Code** is my editor of choice.
- **Orange** is my color of choice since birth. üß°
