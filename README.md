<h1>Hello there!</h1>

- 👋 I’m Jgouken!

- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering! Mainly in JavaScript, Swift, and C.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, trying to get into web development. If I'm able to star the main languages (JavaScript, C languages, HTML, CSS, and Swift), I could be very useful for everyone!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on works and big projects! I like having things to do in an amount of time!
